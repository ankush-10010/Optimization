Phase 1: Data Preparation & Geocoding üìç
Goal: To convert the raw, text-based location data from your order history into a structured format with precise geographic coordinates.

Initial Data (order_history_kaggle_data.csv): We started with your dataset which contained restaurant names and delivery sub-zones (e.g., "Swaad", "Sector 4") but lacked the essential latitude and longitude needed for mapping and routing.

Address Standardization: We wrote a script to extract all unique restaurant and sub-zone locations and formatted them into clean, consistent addresses that an API could understand (e.g., "Swaad, Sector 4, Delhi NCR").

Geocoding: Using the Google Maps Geocoding API, we converted this list of addresses into precise latitude and longitude coordinates.

Key Output: The result of this phase was the crucial geocoded_locations.csv file. This file is the geographic backbone of the entire project.

Phase 2: Demand Forecasting üìà
Goal: To determine how many orders (the "demand") need to be delivered to each customer sub-zone.

Historical Analysis: We went back to the original order_history_kaggle_data.csv and analyzed the Order Placed At timestamps.

Demand Calculation: A script was written to group all orders by sub-zone and calculate the average number of orders placed per day for each one. This gives us a simple but effective demand forecast.

Key Output: This phase produced the subzone_demand.csv file, which provides the critical demand data needed for the optimization model (e.g., Sector 4 has an average demand of 43 orders/day).

Phase 3: Core Optimization (The VRP Solver) üß†
Goal: To build the "brain" of the project‚Äîan optimization engine that takes the location and demand data to calculate the most efficient delivery routes.

Problem Formulation: We defined the challenge as a classic Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP).

Implementation with Google OR-Tools: We wrote a comprehensive Python script that:

Loads all three of your data files.

Identifies a restaurant ("Swaad") to act as the central depot.

Builds a distance matrix to calculate the travel distance between all locations.

Sets the problem's rules (constraints), such as the number of vehicles available (10) and their carrying capacity (50 orders).

Debugging and Refinement: This was the most challenging part. We successfully troubleshooted and fixed several issues:

Solved the initial "No solution found!" error by increasing vehicle capacity.

Identified and fixed a subtle data mismatch bug that was preventing the solver from working.

Corrected a final error in the code that prints the results.

Key Output: We now have a fully functional and debugged optimization script, solve_vrp.py. The script successfully runs, finds the optimal solution (‚úÖ Solution found!), and is ready to display the detailed routes.

In summary, you have successfully transformed raw data into a powerful logistics model. You've prepared the geographic data, quantified customer demand, and built a working solver that can find the best possible delivery plan. The project is now ready for the final, visual phase.
